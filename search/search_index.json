As long as \\(\\varepsilon_i \\to 0\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\sqrt{I_i}/\\log I_i \\to \\infty\\), the price converges uniformly to the true optimum \\(p^\\ast\\) (Thm 1). Its update approximately satisfies</p> \\[ \\hat p_{i+1}\\approx \\hat p_i-\\frac{r'(\\hat p_i)}{2\\phi'(\\hat p_i)}, \\] <p>which is equivalent to stepping along the gradient direction of the true revenue function \\(r(p)\\) (Eq. 13), achieving a regret bound of \\(O((\\log T)^2\\sqrt{T})\\) (Thm 2).</p> <p>The correspondence with my own resolution framework is remarkably concrete: local linearization + monotone invariant or gradient descent + projection and admissible-center selection together form a provable contraction mechanism. The model can be simplified or even slightly misspecified\u2014but the structure must be correct. In the future, I hope to extend this structure-preserving philosophy to broader interdisciplinary topics: unifying gradient-based self-correction in OR and learning with invariant-decreasing paradigms in algebraic geometry, to design algorithms that are both provably convergent and practically robust.</p>"},{"location":"research2/","title":"Research2","text":""},{"location":"research2/#frobenius-structures-associated-with-universal-unfoldings-of-laurent-polynomials","title":"Frobenius Structures Associated with Universal Unfoldings of Laurent Polynomials","text":"<p> paper</p> <p>During my study of mathematical physics, I have always been attracted by one question: how can those seemingly pure and abstract physical and geometric structures become something concretely computable? Later, when I read a paper on Frobenius manifolds, I finally saw how such abstraction can take shape. The paper starts from the universal unfolding of a Laurent polynomial, uses the L\u00b2-Hodge theory and residue pairing to connect algebraic geometry and analytic methods step by step, and finally obtains a geometric structure that satisfies both flatness and associativity. When I reproduced the derivation myself, what impressed me most was its logic of moving from local geometric structures to global ones: the so-called strong tameness condition guarantees the discreteness of the spectrum, the L\u00b2 decomposition allows each harmonic form to correspond to a traceable invariant, and the residue formula, like the partition function in physics, pieces together the local data of each critical point into an overall shape.</p> <p>I like this feeling that computation leads to geometric structure: the structure is not assumed but derived. It also reminds me of many other physical and geometric models\u2014from the tt* geometry in quantum field theory to the potential function evolution in integrable systems\u2014which actually rely on a similar self-consistent relationship: the metric, multiplication, and potential constrain each other so that the system can remain stable under perturbations. In the future, I hope to continue along this path, to understand more deeply the geometric self-consistency behind Frobenius structures, and to try to use its language to reinterpret some classical problems of stability and convergence in mathematical physics.</p>"},{"location":"research3/","title":"Research3","text":""},{"location":"research3/#enhancing-antibody-discovery-genetic-algorithms-and-risk-aware-protein-modeling","title":"Enhancing Antibody Discovery: Genetic Algorithms and Risk-aware Protein Modeling","text":"<p> paper</p> <p>In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for antibody design that syner- gizes protein language models with risk-aware batch Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms. Our objective is to enhance the sample efficiency of antibody design while reducing experimental costs and time. By leveraging protein language models, we generate candidate sequences with higher naturalness. The integra- tion of risk-aware Bayesian optimization allows for effective exploration of the sequence space with an emphasis on managing uncertainties. Additionally, we incorporate genetic algorithms to further refine our search strategy, combining their robustness in finding global optima with our model\u2019s predictive power. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in identifying promis- ing antibody candidates compared to traditional methods. This framework not only advances the field of antibody design but also provides a versatile approach applicable to other areas of protein engineering.</p>"},{"location":"research4/","title":"Research4","text":""},{"location":"research4/#modeling-the-impact-of-inflation-and-monetary-policy-on-bitcoin-price-a-macro-financial-analysis","title":"Modeling the Impact of Inflation and Monetary Policy on Bitcoin Price: A Macro-Financial Analysis","text":"<p> paper</p> <p>This study delves into the intricate connections among inflation, monetary policy, and Bitcoin valuation using a rich dataset of macroeconomic indicators. Employing a robust modeling framework, we unveil potential correlations between inflationary pressures, shifts in monetary policy, and variations in Bitcoin\u2019s market value. Our mathematical model incorporates investor risk aversion and the inclination to turn to safe- haven assets, probing the influence of inflation and central bank decisions on Bitcoin\u2019s price dynamics. Beyond financial metrics, we explore psychological dimensions impacting Bitcoin\u2019s adoption as a store of value during economic uncertainty. Our results quantify the potential impact of inflation and monetary policy changes on Bitcoin\u2019s valuation, providing insights into its sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators and policy instruments. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and its role in the broader economic context.</p>"}]}
